# Andy-s-Algorithm
These scripts were created to simplify the automated analysis of biological assays.

The macros that are available here include
1. IHC
2. Proximity Ligation Assays (PLA)
3. H&E
4. 3D colony assays

Method

1.	Download and install FIJI or update FIJI (version 1.51k or later) [https://fiji.sc]
2.	Download macro (eg IHC.ijm) (Supplementary attachment)
3.	Go to Plugins > Macros > Installâ€¦ in the menu bar of FIJI
4.	Select macro (eg IHC.ijm) to temporarily install macro
5.	Go to Plugins > Macros. The option to use the macro should be in that dropdown menu now.

Note: This temporarily installs the macro into the toolbar of FIJI and will disappear when FIJI is closed. Simply reinstall the macro when you open FIJI again.

Note 2: These macros were designed for single images and not Z-stacks. Convert image stacks to single files before using macros
